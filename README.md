# multitool++

## Cross-platform multitool written in C++

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- C++ Compiler (if you won't use a precompiled binary)
- Linux or Windows system (you may be able to run the software on macOS via WINE)

### Using a compiler
You will first have to download the source code. We recommend using a GitHub release for stability.

It's as simple as compiling `main.cpp`. For example, if you are on Windows and using G++:

```sh
g++ -o main.exe main.cpp
```

### Using the precompiled binaries
You can easily download and run a precompiled binary from the releases.

## IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT

As of this being wrote, our Windows binary is currently detected by multiple antivirus engines on VirusTotal. If you have the time, please report this as a false positive! The program is **NOT** malware. 

[![anyrun report proving it isn't malware](https://img.shields.io/badge/AnyRun_Text_Report-navy)](https://web.archive.org/web/20250505193713/https://any.run/report/bfeb2d8a414bfedc9124072c483acee0a62a9c4f28174ef483b97fba27165b2f/248a5c03-3969-4b37-833a-00c973f34281) <!-- the reason why we are using internet archive is because anyrun public reports are deleted after 2 weeks -->

## FAQ

**Q**: It's detected as malware by Antivirus!  

**A**: Antivirus engines will probably flag files that barely do anything.

**Q**: Will there be a native macOS binary?  

**A**: Too complicated to implement.
